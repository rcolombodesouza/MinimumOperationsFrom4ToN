# MinimumOperationsFrom4ToN
It is possible to reach to any number, starting from 4. The operations are:
- Add 0 at the end of the number
- Add 4 at the end of the number
- Divide by 2
The order of these operations doesn`t matter and you can use them every time needed.


Example:
N = 14
Starting with 4
4 / 2 = 2
2 / 2 = 1
1 add 4 = 14
